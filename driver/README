Copied from ~adev/bob/mlu and modified/updated.

An older, VXWORKS version was on adaql1:~adaq/vme/progflash

The Intel_vme version is mainly what we support here.


Must put v1495.so into 
intehal3:/root/linuxvme/jvme  
(and same for halladaq8, these are local filesystems)

because root's LD_LIBRARY_PATH looks there.
It already had the jvme.so there.
